Version 1.0.0-beta
- Changes
    - Nothing to mention (Initial release)
- Known issues
    - It is not possible to set the 'measurement interval' to fraction of seconds like 3.2s
      as it is not supported by CONTIKI timer. Therefore, to perform a new measurement at every Tx cycle e.i.
      set the measurement rate to highest, you need to set the 'measurement interval' to 3s.
      Hence, there will be an overhead as measurements are faster than the transmission cycle (3 < 3.2). As consequence,
      the SC will fail to send some measurements as it is possible to have two measurements in the same cycle.

Version 1.0.0
- Changes
    - Add TSCH callback function at slot zero to trigger measurement perform if measurement interval is set to
      3s instead of using CONTIKI timer event. This fixes the known issue of the beta release.
    - Use the same TSCH callback to trigger measurement Tx instead of using the CONTIKI timer event as Tx interval is 3.2s.
    - Increment the absolute time every 1s for better resolution and set the deviation limit to 2s.
    - Support simultaneous joining of 30 sensors.
    - Write communication parameters to the flash after adding slave's data slot to the TSCH schedule at the end of
      join process to fix real time corruption issue (stopped beacon Rx and getting status 6 sending measurement).

Version 1.0.1
- Changes
    - Pass the measurement data (structure) by reference to the send function for rapidness and to avoid stack overflow
- Known issues
    - Nothing to mention
